# Task Tracker

A small client-side task tracker that lets users:
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks complete (completed tasks move to the end and show strikethrough)
- Unmark completed tasks to return them to the pending list
- Delete tasks
- Clear completed or clear all

Features:
- Persisted in localStorage
- Accessible controls (keyboard + screen reader friendly)
- Minimal, dependency-free (HTML/CSS/JS)

How to use:
1. Open index.html in a browser.
2. Type a task in the input and press Add (or Enter).
3. Click the checkbox or the task text to toggle completion.
4. Use Delete to remove a task.
5. Clear completed or Clear all to bulk-remove tasks.

Files:
- index.html — UI
- styles.css — simple styling
- script.js — application logic and localStorage persistence
```
